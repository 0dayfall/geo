# geo
Geo is a lightweight toolkit for spatial routing and optimization. It provides great-circle distance, geohash indexing, graph search with Dijkstra and A*, and heuristics for TSP/VRP. Designed for logistics, maritime and mapping use, it enables fast proximity queries, clustering, and path planning on real-world networks.
